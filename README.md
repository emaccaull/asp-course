# Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications

This repository contains the code and assignments as I go through the [Coursera 
course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 (see .python-version file)
- It's best to setup a virtual env for this project
  - Locally, I have a virtual env named "asp" using `penv virtualenv`

**Python Dependencies**
